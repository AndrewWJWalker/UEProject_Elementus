# Codename: Project Elementus (Unnamed Template) - WiP

## The project:

I started this project aiming for a game focused on players who love to troll other players, _like me in Fall Guys xD_

But, I currently don’t have a lot of time to create and work on a complete game, because I literally get into my projects and I don’t want to get too lost in ideas and other factors currently because of my job, college, and personal stuff.
So I decided to turn this “game” into a template that I could slowly use to study new features and help other developers. And to do that, I’m integrating some cool features I’ve seen in the UE5 documentation and samples and also integrating other existing tools.

An example is this plugin I’m making right now:
I really liked the new Modular Game Features plugins and I love the Gameplay Ability System, so I merged these 2 features into one, creating new Actions that the developer could use to add Modular GAS classes like Abilities, Effects and also AttributeSets. I’m also integrating this with the new Enhanced Input system and developing everything with a focus on multiplayer as well. _(This idea was inspired by the UE5 sample Valley of the Ancient)_
